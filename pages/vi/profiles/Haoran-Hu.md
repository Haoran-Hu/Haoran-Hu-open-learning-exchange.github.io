#### About me

Hello everyone, my name is **Haoran Hu**, and you can call me **Travis**. I was recently graduated from the University of Waterloo. I have been living here for about 5 years and I really like it here. I love playing sports and I have won couple awards playing basketball both in high school and university. I am always interested in learning new skills and looking forward to new challenges.
